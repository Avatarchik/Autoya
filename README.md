# Autoya
small, thin framework for Unity with essential game features.

## Features
* Log-in / Log-out
* AssetBundle load/management
* Connection freature
* app-version/asset-version/server-condition changed handles


## Motivation
Unity already contains these feature's foundation, but actually we need more codes for using it in app.

This framework can help that.
